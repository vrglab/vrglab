# Vrglab
Hello hi, Iâ€™m Arad Bozorgmehr aka Vrglab, i am a computer enthusiast and a mad man who experiments with his projects and tries things a bit .... differently. I typically work on games or game related stuff as personal projects, although my day job is to program things in JavaScript, PHP and SQL.
Why ðŸ¤” ? You ask, Well because I can and also I am most comfortable working with C/C++, C#, Java. Because I have been using those languages for far longer than I like to admit (Java 6+ years, C# 5+ years and C/C++ 3+ years). Anyway here, my main (publicly available) projects ( Cause a good 90% of em are private)

# Public Projects
1. [Vrglab's Lib](https://github.com/vrglab/VrglabsLib) Is a Architectury based Moddificattion aimed at making multiplatform data registeration in minecraft across multiple modloaders easier and more streamlined
1. [LowpEngine](https://github.com/vrglab/LowpEngine) Is a Cross-platform C++ based Game Engine i am making that uses C# as it's main game scripting language (Kinda like Unity)
2. [CLIEngine](https://github.com/vrglab/CLIEngine) Is a C# based command line app handler (makes creating cli based tools easier as it handles the dirty process of command and string handeling)
